3. PDP-11/20 console

3.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter provides the information necessary to operate the PDP-11/20 System and associated Model 33 ASR
Teletype. The description is divided into two major parts: controls and indicators, and control interaction.

The description of controls and indicators (Paragraph 3.2) is in tabular form and provides the user with the
location, type, and function of each operating switch and indicator on the programmer's console and teletype.
Operating controls for external devices are beyond the scope of this discussion; for these devices refer to
the appropriate peripheral manual and the Unibus Interface Manual.

The control interaction discussion (Paragraph 3.3) examines the relationships between controls and indicators
and the system. This is an expansion of Paragraph 3.2, Controls and Indicators.

Step-by-step procedures for both manual and program operation are given in Chapter 4.


3.2 CONTROLS AND INDICATORS

The controls and indicators used to operate the PDP-11/20 System are detailed in the following paragraphs.
These paragraphs describe the KYI 1-A programmer's console and the ASR 33 Teletype.

3.2.1 Programmer's Console

Manual operation of the PDP-11/20 System is controlled by switches mounted on the programmer's console (front
panel of the basic mounting box). Visual displays indicate processor operation and the contents of address and
data registers.

All register displays and switches, whether marked on the console or not, are numbered from right to left. The
numbers correspond to the powers of two, i.e., 2^15 ... 2^2, 2^1, 2^0. Therefore, the most significant bit
(MSB) is at the left of each specific register or display, the least significant bit (LSB) is at the right.
Whenever an indicator is on, it denotes the presence of a binary 1 in the particular bit position. The
alternate color coding on the console identifies the different functions or segments of the binary number in
octal format.

Figure 3-1 shows the location of all PDP-11/20 console controls and indicators. Each indicator and associated
function is listed in Table 3-1. Each control and related function is listed in Table 3-2.


DATA indicator:
===============
Type:
-----
16-bit display
MSB at left
Color-coded in 3-bit segments for octal format
Vertical center line divides 16-bit word into 8-bit bytes.
Indicators to right of center line indicate low-order (even) byte;

Function:
---------
Displays the information within the data paths of the processor. This is not a single register, but the
logical sum of two latch registers on the data paths. For most console functions, one register is zeroed while
the other contains the desired information.

This display of the data paths, the central data flow through the processor, is especially important when used
in a single clock mode with the Maintenance Panel Option (KM11-A).

Data is manually loaded into the DATA register (data paths) by setting the data value into the SWITCH REGISTER
and lifting the DEP switch.

Remarks:
--------
When console switches are used, information shown on the DATA display is as follows:

LOAD ADDR - no indication

DEP - the SWITCH REGISTER information just deposited. Note that the data and address correlated. The address
is where this data was stored.

EXAM - the information from the address examined - note address and data correlation.

S-INST - when stepping through a program a single instruction at a time, there is no indication on the DATA
display.

S-CYCLE - the information last in the data paths (refer to flow diagram). Usually is a derivative of last bus
data.

During HALT and WAIT instructions, information shown on DATA display is as follows:

WAIT - The RUN light is on, no indication on DATA display.

HALT - when bus control is transferred to the console on a HALT instruction, processor register RO is
displayed. This allows program identification of halts.

During direct memory access (EMA) operations, the processor is not involved in data transfer functions.
Therefore, the data displayed in the DATA display is not that of the last bus operation.


ADDRESS REGISTER indicator:
============================
Type:
-----
18-bit display MSB at left
Color-coded in 3-bit segments for octal format

Function:
---------
Displays the address in the bus address register (BAR) of the processor. This is the address last used by the
processor on the bus.

The BAR is 18 bits, allowing for future expansion. At present, the two most significant bits (A17, A16) are
ordered according to the lower 16 bits; they are set only when bits A15, A14, and A13 are set. Addresses
between 160000 and 177777, therefore, are translated to addresses between 760000 and 777777, respectively.


Remarks:
--------
When console switches are used, information shown on the ADDRESS REGISTER display is as follows:

LOAD ADDR - the transferred SWITCH REGISTER information

DEP or EXAM — indicates the bus address just deposited into or examined.

S-INST or S-CYCLE — indicates the last processor bus address.

During a programmed HALT or WAIT instruction, the ADDRESS REGISTER displays the address of the instruction.
The program counter (PC) is the BAR value plus 2.

During direct memory access (DMA) operations, the processor is not involved in the data transfer functions,
and the address displayed in the ADDRESS REGISTER is not that of the last bus operation.




RUN indicator:
=============
Type:
-----
Single light

Function:
---------
When the RUN indicator is on, the processor dock is running. The processor has control of the bus and is
operating on an instruction.

When the RUN indicator is off, the processor is waiting for an asynchronous peripheral data response; or the
processor has given up bus control to the console or to a peripheral.


Remarks:
--------
During normal machine operation the RUN light will flicker on and off (indicated by a faint glow).

Special situations exist for programmed HALT and WAIT instructions:
WAIT — the RUN light is completely on
HALT — the RUN light is off

During machine operation, with S-INST or S-CYCLE control transferred to the console, the RUN light is not on.



BUS indicator:
==============
Type:
-----
Single light

Function:
---------
When the BUS indicator is on, a peripheral device (other than the console) is controlling the bus.

Remarks:
--------
When both the BUS and RUN indicators are off, the bus control has been transferred to the console.

The bus light probably is never seen except when there is a bus malfunction or when a peripheral holds the bus
for excessive periods of time. Refer to Paragraph 3.3 for further discussion of BUS and RUN indicator
combinations.

During machine operation with S-INST or S-CYCLE, control is transferred to the console and the BUS indicator
is not on.


NOTES:
======

1. When the processor is in a major machine state (FETCH, EXEC, SOURCE, DESTINATION), the appropriate major
state indicator is on and the following, associated RUN and BUS conditions occur.

a. The RUN indicator is on when the processor clock is running (processor in control of bus).

b. The RUN indicator is off when processor is waiting for data from the bus (processor in control of bus, but
clock is off).

c. The RUN indicator is off and the BUS indicator is on when an NPR is being serviced (processor is not in
control of the bus).

2. There is no major state indicator on the console for the major machine state of Service. In this state,
break requests are honored, machine instructions of WAIT and HALT are executed, and trap sequences for
instruction and bus interrupts are implemented.


FETCH indicator:
=================

Type:
-----
Single light

Function:
---------
When on, the processor is in the FETCH major state and is obtaining an instruction.

Remarks:
--------
During the Fetch major state, only FETCH and RUN indicators are on if no NPRs are honored.


EXEC indicator:
=================
Type:
-----
Single light

Function:
---------
When on the processor is in the EXECUTE major state. The processor performs the action specified by the
instruction. (HALT, WAIT, and trap instructions are executed in Service.)

Remarks:
--------
During the Execute major state, only EXEC and RUN indicators are on if no NPRs are honored.


SOURCE indicator:
=================

Type:
-----
Single light

Function:
---------
When on, the processor is in the Source major state and is obtaining source operand data. The processor
calculates source address data as indicated by cycles of the ADDRESS lights.


Remarks:
--------
During the Source major state, SOURCE and RUN indicators are both on; ADDRESS lights may be on in various
combinations. The BUS indicator is off if no NPRs are honored.


DESTINATION indicator:
=====================

Type:
-----
Single light

Function:
---------
When on, the processor is in the Destination major state and is obtaining destination operand data. The
processor calculates destination address data as indicated by cycles of the ADDRESS lights.


Remarks:
--------
During the Destination major state, DESTINATION and RUN indicators are both on; ADDRESS lights may be on in
various combinations. The BUS indicator is off if no NPRs are honored.


ADDRESS indicator:
=================
Type:
-----
Two lights representing a 2-bit binary code

MSB is on the left

Function:
---------
When lit, indicate bus cycles used to obtain address data during Source and Destination major states.

The 2-bit binary code indicates which address cycle (1, 2, or 3) the machine is in during the Source or
Destination major state.

Remarks:
--------
Whenever either one or both ADDRESS lights are lit, either the SOURCE or DESTINATION indicator is on.

The BUS indicator is off if no NPRs are honored.


OFF/POWER/PANEL LOCK control:
==============================
Type:
-----
3-position, key operated switch

Function:
---------
Provides power control to console and lock-out of console controls as follows:

OFF position - removes all power from the processor.

POWER position - applies primary power to the processor. All console controls are fully operational when
switch is in this position.

PANEL LOCK position disables all console (panel) controls except the SWITCH REGISTER key switches. This
prevents inadvertant switch operation from disturbing a running program.

The data entered in the SWITCH REGISTER are still available to the processor whenever the program explicitly
addresses the SWITCH REGISTER (address 777570).



SWITCH REGISTER  control:
=========================
Type:
-----
18-key-type switches

Bit position of each switch is labeled; MSB is at left.

Color-coded in 3-bit segments for octal format.

Up position — logical one (or on). Down position — logical zero (or off)


Function:
---------
Provides a means of manually loading a 16-bit address or 16-bit data word into the processor. The processor
ignores bits 17 and 16; these switches may be set to either position. For addresses using bits 17 and 16,
these bits are set within the processor if bits 15, 14, and 13 are set.

If the word in the SWITCH REGISTER represents an address, it can be loaded into the ADDRESS REGISTER by
depressing the LOAD ADDR key.

If the word contains data, it is loaded into the address specified by the ADDRESS REGISTER by lifting the DEP
key. The data appear in the DATA display.

The contents of the SWITCH REGISTER may be used by the processor any time the program explicitly addresses the
register at address 777570. This address can only be used by the processor.


LOAD ADDR control:
=================

Type:
-----
Momentary key-type switch

Depress to activate


Function:
---------
The LOAD ADDR switch transfers the SWITCH REGISTER contents to the Bus Address Register (BAR) through a
temporary location (TEMP) within the processor. This bus address, displayed in the ADDRESS REGISTER, provides
an address for the console functions of EXAM, DEP, and START.

Remarks:
--------
Odd bus address (bit 00 enabled) should not be entered from the console. Upper bytes at these odd addresses
can be examined or deposited by using the word address (bit 00 not enabled). Refer to Paragraph 3.3.1.5.


EXAM control:
=============
Type:
-----
Momentary key-type switch

Depress to activate

Function:
---------
The EXAM switch transfers the contents of the bus address (which is specified by the Bus Address Register) for
DATA display. After use, the data appear on the DATA display and the address of the data is in the ADDRESS
REGISTER.

A LOAD ADDR operation pre-establishes the initial address; sequential addresses occur automatically.

If the EXAM switch is depressed twice in succession, the contents of the next sequential bus address are
displayed in DATA. This action is repeated each time EXAM is depressed provided no other switch is used
between these steps.

Whenever the LOAD ADDR or DEP switch is depressed, it destroys the incrementing sequence. The next time EXAM
is used, it displays the current Bus Address Register address rather than the next sequential address.

Remarks:
--------
Refer to Paragraph 3.3 for further discussion of address incrementation by the EXAM switch.



CONT control:
=================
Type:
-----
Momentary key-type switch

Depress to activate

Function:
---------
Causes the processor to continue operation from the previous point at which it had stopped

If the ENABLE/HALT switch is in the ENABLE mode, CONT returns bus control from the console to the processor
and continues program operation.

If the ENABLE/HALT switch is set to HALT, depressing the CONT key causes the processor to perform either a
single instruction or a single bus cycle (dependent on position of the S-INST/S-CYCLE switch) and then stop.
Bus control has been returned to the console and the CONT switch must be used to continue.


Remarks:
--------
If program stops, depressing CONT provides a restart without power clear.


ENABLE/HALT control:
====================
Type:
-----
2-position, key-type switch

Function:
---------
Allows either the program or the console to control processor operation

ENABLE position - permits the system to run in a normal manner. No console control requests (type dependent
upon S-INST/S-CYCLE switch) are made. Without console control, all switches except ENABLE/HALT and the SWITCH
REGISTER are disabled.

HALT position - halts the processor and passes control to the console; with the S-INST/S-CYCLE switch in the
S-CYCLE mode, console switches (except SWITCH REGISTER, CONT, and ENABLE/HALT) are disabled unless the machine
is stepped to the end of an instruction. In the S-INST mode, the processor stops at the end of an instruction
and all console switches are enabled.

The HALT mode is used with the CONT switch to step the machine through programs and facilitate intermediate
observations.

When the START switch is activated in the HALT mode, a system clear is effected.


Remarks:
--------
Continuous program control requires the ENABLE mode.

The HALT mode is used to interrupt program control, perform single step operation, or clear the system.


S-INST/S-CYCLE control:
=======================

Type:
-----
2-position, key-type switch

Function:
---------
Allows the processor to step through program operation either one instruction or one bus cycle at a time. The
user may note processor operation and contents of registers during major states or bus cycles of individual
instructions.

S-INST position - the processor halts after an instruction. This process is repeated each time the CONT key is
depressed. Console switches (LOAD ADDR, EXAM, DEP) can be used when the processor halts.

S-CYCLE position - The processor halts after a bus cycle. The process is repeated each time CONT is depressed.
Console switches are inoperative unless the machine is stepped to the S-INST halt position. (Changing mode to
S-INST and using CONT switch effects this.)


Remarks:
--------
This switch is enabled by the ENABLE/HALT switch in HALT mode.

S-INST: Control is transferred to the console by a console bus request (CBR), second highest priority and
serviced at instruction end.

S-CYCLE: Control is transferred to the console by a console nonprocessor request (CNPR), highest priority and
serviced after a bus cycle.


START control:
=================
Type:
-----
Momentary key-type switch

Depress to activate

Function:
---------
When ENABLE/HALT is set to ENABLE, depressing START provides a system dear operation and then begins processor
operation. A LOAD ADDR operation pre-establishes the starting address.

When ENABLE/HALT is set to HALT, depressing START provides a system clear (initialize) only. The processor
does not start; the Bus Address Register is loaded from a temporary processor register (TEMP) which is usually
pre-loaded by LOAD ADDR.

This provides the only method of reading TEMP when it does not contain the LOAD ADDR value.


DEP control:
=================
Type:
-----
Momentary key-type switch

Lift to activate


Function:
---------
The DEP switch transfers the contents of the console SWITCH REGISTER to the bus address (specified by the Bus
Address Register). After use, the data appear on the DATA display and the address is in the ADDRESS REGISTER.
A LOAD ADDR operation pre-establishes the initial address; sequential addresses occur automatically.

If the DEP switch is raised twice in succession, the contents of the SWITCH REGISTER is deposited in the next
sequential bus address location. This action is repeated each time DEP is raised provided no other switch is
used between these steps. Whenever the LOAD ADDR or EXAM switch is depressed, it destroy the incrementing
sequence. The next time DEP is used, it deposits the current address rather than the next sequential address.


Remarks:
--------
Refer to Paragraph 3.3 for further discussion of address incrementation of locations by DEP switch.
