CHAPTER 3 OPERATION

3.1. CONTROLS AND INDICATORS

3.1.1 Computer

Figure 3-1 shows the location of the PDP-8/I controls and indicators. Although
not marked on the front panel, register bits are numbered from left to right
starting with zero. Therefore the most significant (leftmost) bit in the program
counter (PC) is identified as PC00, and the least (rightmost) significant bit is
identified as PC11. Table 3-1 contains a listing of the PDP-8/I controls and
indicators within their functions. The PDP-8/I controls (except the power and
panel lock switches) are of two types: butterfly switches, and momentary-contact
switches. The butterfly switches are considered to be in their zero or off-state
when the top half of the butterfly is fully depressed, and are considered to be
in their one or on state when the bottom half of the butterfly is depressed. The
momentary-contact switches include the Start, Exam, Load Add, Cont, Dep and Stop
switches. These switches (except Dep) are actuated when the bottom half is fully
depressed. The Dep switch is the reverse of the above. Indicators are considered
to be in their on or one state when they are lit, and in their off or zero state
when not lit.

Table 3-1 Computer Controls And Indicators

Control or Indicator    Function
--------------------    --------------------------------------------------------
Panel Lock key switch   When turned clockwise, this key-operated switch disables
                        all controls except the Switch Register switches on the
                        operator console. In this condition, inadvertent key
                        operation cannot disturb the program. The program can,
                        however, monitor the content of SR by execution of the
                        OSR instruction.

Power key switch        This key-operated switch controls application of primary
                        power to the computer. When this switch is turned
                        clockwise, primary power is applied.

Start key               Starts the program by turning off the program interrupt
                        circuits clearing the AC and L, setting the Fetch state,
                        and starts the central processor.

Load Add key            This key transfers the content of SR into PC, the content
                        of INST FIELD° switches into IF, the content of the DATA
                        FIELD° switches into DF, and clears the major state
                        flip-flops.

Dep key                 This key transfers the content of SR into MB and core memory
                        at the address specified by the current content of PC.
                        The major state flip-flops are cleared. The contents of
                        PC is then incremented by one to allow storing of
                        information in sequential core memory addresses by
                        repeated operation of the Dep key.

Exam key                This key transfers the content of core memory at the address
                        specified by the content of PC, into the MB. The content
                        of the PC is then incremented by one to allow
                        examination of the contents of sequential core memory
                        addresses by repeated operation of the Exam key. The
                        major state flip-flop register cleared. The MA indicates
                        the address of the data in the MB.

Cont key                This key sets the RUN flip-flop to continue the program
                        in the state and instruction designated by the lighted
                        console indicators, at the address currently specified
                        by the PC if key SS is not on.

Stop key                Causes the RUN flip-flop to be cleared at the end of the
                        instruction in progress at the time the key is pressed.

Sing Step key           This key causes the RUN flip-flop to be cleared to disable
                        the timing circuits at the end of one cycle of
                        operation. Thereafter, repeated operation of the Cont
                        key steps the program one cycle at a time so that the
                        operator can observe the contents of registers in each
                        major state.

Sing Inst key           This key allows execution of one instruction. When the
                        computer is started by pressing the Start or Cont key,
                        the Sing Inst key causes the RUN flip-flop to be cleared
                        at the end of the last cycle of the current instruction.
                        Thereafter, repeated operation of the Cont key steps the
                        program one instruction at a time.

Switch Register         Provide a means of manually setting a 12-bit word into
                        switches the machine. Load the content of this register
                        into PC by pressing the Load Add key or load the content
                        into the MB and core memory by the Dep key. Under
                        program control, the OSR and LAS instructions can set
                        the content of SR into AC.

Data Field indicators   The indicators denote the content of the data field
and switches°           register (DF), and the switches serve as an extension of
                        SR to load DF by means of the Load Add key. DF
                        determines the core memory field of data storage and
                        retrieval.

Inst Field indicators   The indicators denote the content of the instruction
and switches°           field register (IF), and the switches serve as an extension
                        of SR to load the IF by means of the Load Add key. IF
                        determines the core memory field from which instructions
                        are to be taken.

                        indicators be performed.

Memory Address          Indicate the content of MA. Usually, the contents of MA
indicators              denote the core memory address of the word currently or
                        previously read or written. After operation either the
                        Dep or Exam key, the contents of MA indicate the core
                        memory address just examined or deposited into.

Memory Buffer           Indicates the content of MB. Usually, the contents of MB
                        indicators designate the word just written at the core
                        memory address in MA.

                        the product at the conclusion. It holds the
                        least-significant half of the dividend at the start of
