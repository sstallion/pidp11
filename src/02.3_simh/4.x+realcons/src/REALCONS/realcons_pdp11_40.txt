1. PDP11/40 Console Indicators

1.1. Indicator DATA

1.1.1. Type
16-bit display
MSB at left
Color-coded in 3-bit segments for octal format
Byte division noted with additional indexing for octal format in upper byte

1.1.2. Function
Displays the output of a processor data multiplexer which gates information from
a variety of sources within the processor. Normal programming use results in the
following displays:

HALT instruction has R(00)
RESET instruction has R(00)
WAIT instruction has R(IR)
SINGLE STEP and HALT switch has Processor Status (PS)

The display of the data multiplexer is especially important when used in the
single clock mode.  During this mode, the KM11 Maintenance Console is used to
step through a program a single microword at a time. In this instance, the
information in the DATA display is the result of a single microword and shown on
the processor flow diagrams (refer to KD11-A Processor Manual).

1.1.3. Remarks
When console switches are used, information shown on the DATA display is as follows:

LOAD ADRS - the transferred Switch register address.

DEP - the Switch register data just deposited. Note that data and address are
correlated. The address is where this data was stored.

EXAM - the information from the address examined. Note address and data correlate.

HALT - displays the current Processor Status (PS) word.

When a programmed HALT instruction is issued, bus control is transferred to the
console and processor register RO is displayed on the DATA display. This allows
program identification of halts.

During DMA operations, the processor is not involved in data transfer functions.
Therefore, the data displayed in the DATA display is not that of the last bus
operation.


1.2. Indicator ADDRESS

1.2.1 Type
18-bit display
MSB at left
Color-coded in 3-bit segments for octal format

1.2.2. Function
Displays the address in the Bus Address register (BAR) of the processor.  This
varies with an instruction execution but for a HALT, WAIT, or single step
operation, the program counter is displayed between operations. The updated (or
incremented) value of the program counter is always displayed.

If the KT11-D Memory Management Option is not included in the system, the two
most significant bits (A17, A16) are ordered according to the lower 16 bits;
they are set only when bits A15, A14, and A 13 are all set. Addresses between
160000 and 177777, therefore, are translated to addresses between 760000 and
777777, respectively.

If the KT11-D option is installed, the ADDRESS display usually displays a
virtual address with the KT11-D providing an offset physical bus address (not
displayed). During console operations, however, the console provides and
displays a full 18-bit physical address.

1.2.3. Remarks
When console switches are used, information shown on the ADDRESS display is as
follows:

LOAD ADRS - the transferred Switch register address.

DEP or EXAM - indicates the bus address just deposited into or examined.

During a programmed HALT or WAIT instruction, the ADDRESS displays the
incremented address of the instruction. The BAR is the instruction location plus 2.

In single instruction mode, the next PC is placed into the BAR and displayed in
ADDRESS between instructions.

During DMA operations, the processor is not involved in the data transfer
functions, and the address displayed in the ADDRESS display is not that of the
last bus operation.

Within instructions, the display indicates various processor bus addresses.
These values are apparent only in a maintenance mode, using the KM11 and single
clocking.


1.3. Indicator RUN

1.3.1. Type
Single light

1.3.2. Function
When the RUN indicator is on, the processor clock is running and is operating on
an instruction or looping in console operation.

When the RUN indicator is off, the microprogramming is not processing an
instruction. The processor may be in control of the bus and awaiting a response
for a data transfer; or the processor may have refilinquished bus control for
an NPR or BR request.

1.3.3. Remarks
During normal machine operation, the RUN light flickers on and off (indicated by
a faint glow).

A programmed RESET command turns off the RUN light. This also occurs between
single clocks when the KM11 Maintenance Console is used.

For programmed HALT and WAIT instructions, the clock continues to run with the
processor looping in the microprogram. This is also true for console operation
from the HALT switch


1.4. Indicator PROC

1.4.1. Type
Single light

1.4.2. Function
When on, indicates that the processor is controlling the Unibus as the master device.

1.4.3. Remarks
When the PROC light is on and the RUN light is off, the processor is waiting for
data from the bus.


1.5. Indicator BUS

1.5.1. Type
Single light

1.5.2. Function
When on, indicates that some device has control of the Unibus. If the PROC
indicator is lighted, that device is the processor.

1.5.3. Remarks
This display is useful for determining where bus control is and that it is present.


1.6. Indicator CONSOLE

1.6.1. Type
Single light

1.6.2. Function
When on, indicates that the processor is in the console mode (manual operation).
Control switch activation is sensed and acted upon.

1.6.3. Remarks
NPRs and BRs are not serviced in the console mode. Bus errors are also serviced
differently (see Table 3.2 for details).


1.7. Indicator USER

1.7.1. Type
Single light

1.7.2. Function
When on, indicates that the processor is in the user mode and certain KT11-D
restrictions on instruction operation and processor status (PS) word loading
exist. Refer to the KT11-D option discussion in Chapter 4 of this manual and
the KT11-D manual.

1.7.3. Remarks
Does not function unless the KT11-D Memory Management Option has been installed
in the system.


1.8. Indicator VIRTUAL

1.8.1. Type
Single light

1.8.2. Function
When on, indicates that a virtual address is displayed in the ADDRESS display.
This virtual address is usually modified by the KT11-D option to provide a
different physical address for the Unibus. If the KT11-D option is installed,
this display is usually active during program operation. During console
operation, the console ADDRESS display and Switch register both provide a full
18-bit physical address. The VIRTUAL light is off in this instance.

When VIRTUAL light's off, it indicates that the bus address indicated by the
ADDRESS display is the physical address.

1.8.3. Remarks
Does not function unless the KT11-D Memory Management Option has been installed
in the system.



2. PDP11/40 Console Controls

2.1. Switch OFF/POWER/LOCK

2.1.1. Type
3-position, key operated switch

2.1.2. Function
Provides system power control and lock-out of console controls as follows:

OFF position - removes all power from the system. (System not being used.)


POWER position - applies primary power to the system. All console controls are
fully operational when switch is in this position. (Normal Operation.)

LOCK position - disables all console (panel) controls except the Switch register
key switches. This prevents inadvertent control switch operation from disturbing
a running program. (System operating, console control disabled.)

The data entered in the Switch register is still available to the processor
whenever the program explicitly addresses the Switch register (address 777570).

2.1.3. Remarks


2.2. Switch register

2.2.1. Type
18 key-type switches
Bit position of each switch is labeled; MSB is at left.
Color-coded in 3-bit segments for octal format.
Up position - logical one (or on). Down position - logical zero (or off).

2.2.2. Function
Provides a means of loading an address or data word into the processor.

If the word in the Switch register represents an address, it can be loaded into
the ADDRESS register by depressing the LOAD ADRS key.

If the word contains data, it is loaded into the address specified by the
ADDRESS register by lifting the DEP key.

If the KT11-D Memory Management Option used, bits 17 and 16 are directly used
as the physical bus address during console operation.

If the KT11-D option is not installed, the processor bus address bits 17 and 16
are set if Switch register bits 15, 14, and 13 are all set. Bits 17 and 16 of the
Switch register have no effect.

The contents of the Switch register may be used by the processor any time the
program explicitly addresses the register at address 777570. This address can
only be used by the processor.

2.2.3. Remarks


2.3. Switch LOAD ADRS

2.3.1. Type
Momentary key-type switch
Depress to activate


2.3.2. Function
The LOAD ADRS switch transfers the contents of the Switch register to the Bus
Address register (BAR) through a temporary location R(ADRSC) within the
processor. This bus address, displayed in ADDRESS, provides an address for the
console functions of EXAM, DEP, and START.

2.3.3. Remarks
The address is loaded into a temporary location which is not modified during
program execution. To restart a program at a previously specified address, it is
only necessary to depress the START switch.

NOTE: Consecutive examine or deposit functions increment the value of the loaded
address both in the BAR and in R(ADRSC).

Console operations are word-ordered operations. If an odd bus address (bit 00
enabled) is used, the odd address is stored in the Bus Address register and the
temporary location. Examine or deposit operations on this address will be
treated as word operations (bit 00 is ignored).


2.4. Switch EXAM

2.4.1. Type
Momentary key-type switch
Depress to activate

2.4.2. Function
The EXAM switch uses the contents of R(ADRSC) as a bus address; the contents of
this bus address is displayed in DATA, the bus address is displayed in ADDRESS.

A LOAD ADRS operation usually pre-establishes the initial R(ADRSC) address;
sequential examines automatically update R(ADRSC).

If the EXAM switch is depressed twice in succession, the contents of R(ADRSC) is
word incremented and the next sequential bus address is examined. This action
is repeated each time EXAM is depressed provided no other switch is used between
these steps. When the LOAD ADRS or DEP switch is depressed, it destroys the
incrementing sequence. The next time EXAM is used, it displays the current
address rather than the next sequential address.


2.4.3. Remarks
If an odd address is examined, bit 00 is ignored. For example, if address 1001
is examined, the address 1000 to displayed in ADDRESS. Byte data for location
1001 is located in DATA (bits 15-08).

An EXAM operation that references a non-existent address causes a time out (with
no TRAP) and the Switch register address (777570) is displayed in DATA.


2.5. Switch CONT

2.5.1. Type
Momentary key-type switch
Depress to activate

2.5.2. Function
Causes the processor to continue operation from the point at which it had
stopped.

If the ENABLE/HALT switch is in the ENABLE mode, CONT returns bus control from
the console to the processor and continues program operation.

If the ENABLE/HALT switch is set to HALT, depressing the CONT key causes the
processor to perform a single instruction. Control is returned to the console
after each instruction, permitting a program to be stepped through one
instruction at a time. BRs and interrupts are serviced in this mode of
operation.

2.5.3. Remarks
If program stops, depressing CONT provides a restart without power clear.
Because the restart occurs through the service portion of machine operation, any
outstanding BRs may be serviced before program operation.


2.6. Switch ENABLE/HALT

2.6.1. Type
2-position, key-type switch

2.6.2. Function
Allows either the program or the console to control processor operation.

ENABLE position - permits the system to run in a normal manner. No console
control requests are made.

HALT position - halts the processor after the next instruction or outstanding
TRAP sequences, and before Unibus Bus Requests service, and passes control to
the console.

The HALT mode is used with the CONT switch to step the machine through programs
one instruction at a time.

When the START switch is activated in the HALT mode, a system clear is effected
without program start. This mode of operation is useful for clearing conditions
in the system that might prevent proper operation. When the START switch is
activated in the ENABLE mode, it provides a system clear with a program start.

2.6.3. Remarks
Continuous program control requires the ENABLE mode.

The HALT mode is used to interrupt program control, perform single instruction
operation, or clear the system.


2.7. Switch START

2.7.1. Type
Momentary key-type switch
Depress to activate initialize, release to have START function occur.


2.7.2. Function
Depressing the START switch provides a system clear (initialize). When the
ENABLE/HALT switch is set to HALT, the processor does not start.

When ENABLE/HALT is set to ENABLE, releasing START begins processor operation.
The starting address is that of the last console operation determined by
R(ADRSC). Usually, this temporary location is loaded from the Switch register
by a LOAD ADRS operation.

If the program stops at any time, it can be restarted at its original location
by the START switch: the value of R(ADRSC) remains unchanged.

Use of the START switch in the HALT mode provides for a system clear. This mode
of operation is useful for clearing conditions that might prevent proper
operation.

2.7.3. Remarks


2.8. Switch DEP

2.8.1. Type
Momentary key type switch
Lift to activate

2.8.2. Function
The DEP switch uses the contents of R(ADRSC) as a bus address. The contents of
the Switch register are transferred to this location. After use, the data
appears on the DATA display and the address is on the ADDRESS display.

A LOAD ADRS operation usually preestablishes the initial address; sequential DEP
operations automatically update R(ADRSC).

If the DEP switch is raised twice in succession, the contents of the Switch
register is deposited in the next sequential bus address location. This action
is repeated each time DEP is raised provided no other switch is used between
these steps. Whenever the LOAD ADRS or EXAM switch is depressed, it destroys the
incrementing process. The next time DEP is used, it deposits the current address
rather than the next sequential address.

2.8.3. Remarks
If an attempt is made to deposit an odd address, bit 00 is ignored and a word
deposit occurs.

A deposit operation that references a non-existent address causes a time out
(with no TRAP). No error message is visible front the console for a deposit to a
non-existent address. An immediate verification by an examine operation,
however, would result in the display of the Switch register address in the DATA
display.
